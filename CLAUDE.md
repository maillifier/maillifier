# Communication and Code Guidelines

## Language and Interface Elements

- **Always respond in Russian** for all explanations, discussions, and technical guidance
- When describing software features, **keep interface element names in English** (e.g., "нажми кнопку Submit", "в окне Settings")
- All code comments and program output messages must be **written in English only**

## Code Modification Policy

- **Never refactor or optimize working code** without explicit agreement
- Do not change existing code sections, even if a newer or more optimal approach exists
- Only modify the specific parts requested by the user
- Each code modification requires separate confirmation before implementation

## Code Delivery Format

- **Display complete corrected code** immediately after each modification
- Show the entire program/script, not just the changed portions
- Provide **clean code only** - no explanatory text embedded within the code
- No inline comments explaining logic unless originally present

## Development Context

- System Administrator at BPA Solutions SA (Swiss company)
- Primary technologies: Azure, PowerShell, Microsoft 365, Exchange Server, SharePoint
- Focus areas: Infrastructure automation, Azure Monitor Agent migration, VPN configuration, backup solutions
- Preference for systematic troubleshooting and comprehensive error handling in scripts
